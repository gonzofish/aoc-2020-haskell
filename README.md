# AoC 2020 in Haskell

This repository has my solutions and notes for doing the Advent of Code 2020 problems.

As with most AoC repos, I'm sure this one will sputter out. But before that, I'll tag at every part. So tags will be like `01a`, `01b`, `02a`, `02b`, `03a`, etc.

Each day will have its own folder (`01`, `02`, etc.) with the source for that part in it (`01a`, `01b`, etc.).
